Accomplishment:

Today I figured out how to set up my github code to host a bunch of static pages.  Previous two days, I got my own "resume" page up and was pretty proud.  Then, I figured out how to make blog posts (the ones on this page).  Many years ago, I remember seeing someone create a personal page with a cool timeline that showcases their academic journey througout the years. I thought
that was extremely cool and wanted to do something similar.  Start googling and found out its something very commonly done and is called a "vertical timeline".  There was a ton of examples out there, so I browsed through many different template and code to see how its done. 

Some further googling revealed to me that github pages can basically host any static pages, so anything with html, css, and a bit of javascript.  Just not more complicated things that required server computation.  With this in mind, I was able to follow a few online examples of how to do vertical timelines with a bit of dynamic interaction. 
I think this is extremely cool as I can make my profile/resume page a lot more interactive and professional looking.  I've got some basic skeleton code up, and I believe once I fill  it with relevant information, it can give a very nice touch.  I am also looking forward to building a lot more projects on my own, and i can use these static pages to showcase/summarize the various projects I will be working on.  I'm pretty stocked and excited about this!

Unforunately, not everyone shares this same opinion as me.  I shared with someone my exciting new achievement and I got a lackluster response on .. you spent time on this?  Shouldnt' you just be grinding leetcode and system design?  I disagreed and explained that yes, those are important but i dont think its a good to be so unbalanced in preparation.  I think doing some hands on coding and exploring will be very nice addition and give me a better chance to showcase my abilities.  I'm not hoping to gain millions of views or a ton of attentio0n, but i just wanted to work on something for myself, even if the immediate payout won't be there. 

I plan to maintain the following sites in the near future
michelleyho.github.io
michelleyho.gitihub.io/blog
michelleyho.github.io/portfoilio
