Today I figured out how to set up my github repository to host a bunch of static pages.  Previous two days, I launched my "resume" page and was pretty proud.  Then, I figured out how to make blog posts like the ones on this page.  Many years ago, I remember seeing someone create a personal page with a cool timeline that showcases their academic journey througout the years. I want to implement something like that highlight my achievements in the next couple of months.  Started googling and found out I needed something known as a "vertical timeline" There were a ton of examples for me to browse and look into the code for.

Some further googling revealed to me that github pages can basically host any static pages, so anything with html, css, and even bit of javascript.  Just not more complicated things that require server computation.  With this in mind, I was able to follow a few online examples of how to do vertical timelines with a bit of dynamic interaction. This way, I can make my profile/resume page more interactive and professional looking.  I've got some basic skeleton code up, and I believe once I fill  it with relevant information, it can give a very nice touch.  I am also looking forward to building a lot more projects on my own, and I can use these static pages to showcase/summarize the various projects I will soon be working on.  I'm pretty excited.

Unforunately, not everyone shares this same opinion as me.  I shared with someone my exciting new achievement and I got a lackluster response of.. you spent time on this?  Shouldnt' you just be grinding leetcode and system design?  I disagreed and explained that yes, those are important but i dont think its a good to be so unbalanced in preparation.  I think doing some hands on coding and exploring will be very nice addition and give me a better chance to showcase my abilities.  I'm not hoping to gain millions of views or a ton of attentio0n, but I just wanted to work on something for myself, even if the immediate payout isn't there.

I plan to maintain the following sites in the near future
michelleyho.github.io
michelleyho.gitihub.io/blog
michelleyho.github.io/portfoilio
